        <p> If you were asked to "simplify" 200 seconds you would not say, "3.3333333 minutes. You would say 3 minutes and 20 seconds"</p>
		<p> If you were asked to “simplify” 1000000 (one million seconds) you would say, “11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds”.</p>
        <p> And if you were asked to “simplify” 1000000000 (one billion seconds) you would say, “31 years, 259 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds”. Once we are asked to simplify a number of seconds greater than 31536000 we will assume that a year is exactly 365 days long.</p>

        <p>Programming Problem:</p>
        <div class="pastproblem">
            <p>Input: a positive integer N less than 2000000000 representing the number of seconds. <br>
                Output: N seconds "simplified into years, days, hours minutes, and seconds. You must only output the units starting with the greatest unit that has a value greater than 0."</p>
