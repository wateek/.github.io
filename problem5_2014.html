        <p><u>Background Information:</u></p>
        <p> The Acme Software Company wants to develop a program that will determine the minimum number of coins needed for any value between 0 and 99 cents.
		They want the program to be general enough to allow for the input of up to 10 types of coins. For example, in the U.S., we usually consider coins 
		of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents. The minimum number of coins needed for 71 cents is 4: a 50, 10, 10, and 1. In Bionia, there are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 cent coins.
		The minimum number of coins needed for 71 cents is 4: a 64, 4, 2, and 1. </p>

            <p>Input: A positive integer N between 1 and 10 for the number of coins used in a country followed
			by the values of the coins C1, C2, C3, â€¦ CN, from largest to smallest, followed by an integer A between 1 and 99 (inclusive)
			the amount of change to be made. There will be one integer per input line. Also, CN will always be equal to 1 so there will always be a solution.  </p><br>
                <p> The amount of change to be made followed by an equal sign, followed by the coin values in descending order, separated by plus signs on 
				the first line followed on the next line by the number of coins required. </p>
