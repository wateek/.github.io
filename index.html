		<p> For the past 20 years Siena College has run a high school programming contest in which students compete and solve complex Computer Science problems. 
		These students complete the problems assigned in workshop rooms that they are assigned to. In these rooms supervisors and faculty will be present for 
		the students in order to insure the integrity of the contest as well as resources in case students are confused about an task. </p>
